NETWORK DESIGN AND PLANNING
=============================

Prelude
--------
An organization’s IT network is the backbone of its activity as it connects all its computers and related devices together, allowing staff to work more efficiently across the organization. With something so critical, it is crucial to design and set up properly. 
Today, the Internet-based economy often demands 24x7 customer service. This means that networks must be available nearly 100% of the time. They must be smart enough to automatically protect against unexpected security incidents. These networks must also be able to adjust to changing traffic loads to maintain consistent application response times. It is no longer practical to construct networks by connecting many standalone components without careful planning and design.

What is Network Design ?
------------
Network design is the planning phase an Organization’s IT infrastructure must go through before it is implemented. It involves evaluating and understanding how all the elements of the network link together (from routers, switches, and servers to desktops, laptops, and printers) and how they can be made to run as efficiently as possible. A well-designed network can bring increased operational efficiency.
Network design is a complicated process involving evaluating and scoping the network to be implemented. The design process is typically depicted in the form of a network diagram, which is the blueprint for the physical implementation of the network. Network design will typically include the cabling structure, a logical map of the network to be implemented, the quantity of network devices, the type of network devices, the location of network devices, the IP addressing structure, and the network security architecture.

Fundamental Design Goals
------------------
**Scalability:** Scalable network designs can grow to include new user groups and remote sites and can support new applications without impacting the level of service delivered to existing users. 

**Availability:** A network designed for availability is one that delivers consistent, reliable performance, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In addition, the failure of a single link or piece of equipment should not significantly impact network performance. 

**Security:** Security is a feature that must be designed into the network, not added on after the network is complete. Planning the location of security devices, filters, and firewall features is critical to safeguarding network resources. 

**Manageability:** No matter how good the initial network design is, the available network staff must be able to manage and support the network. A network that is too complex or difficult to maintain cannot function effectively and efficiently.

Network Design Tools
--------------------
To help with the physical implementation process, the network design should be drawn out as a network diagram, which then acts as a guide for when the engineers come to install it. Various tools are available in the market below are some of them: SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper, CADE (free), Microsoft Visio, Network Notepad (free), Diagram Designer (free), EDraw etc

Physical Network Design
--------------------------
**Local Area Network design:**

LAN design consists of selecting appropriate devices such as Hubs, Bridges, Switches, and Routers. Criteria for selecting LAN devices include the following:
 - Number of ports required
- Speed (10Mbps/100Mbps/1Gbps)
- Media considerations, such as Ethernet, Token Ring etc.
- Support for different network protocols such as TCP, VOIP etc.
- Ease of configuration, maintainability & management

Depending on the requirement and management considerations, LAN may be configured with either one of the different LAN topologies viz. Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree & Hybrid.

**Wide Area Network design:**

Various WAN technologies are available for connecting enterprise resources. A few prominent technologies are given below:

- Frame Relay
- Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
- Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
- MPLS
- TCP/IP

The technology that suits an enterprise requirement depends on the bandwidth and QoS requirements, security requirements, and application requirements.
In the July 2020 edition of the Networking series article, we have seen that SDWAN enables transport independence of underlay network. Thus, with SD-WAN, it provides us the capability to fully optimize multiple WAN links across the network

Computer Network - Operation and Security
------------
Having fleshed out the physical networking infrastructure, let us try to touch up in brief the operations and security aspects of the network. Every organization likely has a network operations center (NOC) and a security operations center (SOC), both of which play an important role in the day-to-day operations. NOC prioritizes IT performance, while SOC focuses exclusively on security.
The Network Operations are managed using Network Monitoring Systems having capabilities including:
 - Endpoint monitoring and management
- Incident identification, classification, and resolution
- Network Traffic management
- Patch management
- IT performance reporting

In the previous Networking series article, we went into detail of the network perimeter and components to secure it. The SOC team is responsible for implementation of security provisions. The security provisions from Network perspective typically includes the following:
- Firewalls, IPS, IDS, proxy servers, or gateway configuration
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) formation and implementation
- SNMP configuration and monitoring
- Security hot fixes of various devices, operating systems, and applications.
- Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery
