Dear Readers,
==============

In year 2020, Human civilization faced unforeseen situations like COVID-19 crisis, Locust attack, and unprecedented country-wide lockdowns across the world. Thankfully the worst is over and entire world is welcoming year 2021 with new zeal, excitement and vision. This year would definitely come as a year of healing, recovery, and resurgence. It will certainly rescript the growth narrative which was disrupted by events of year 2020. One of the key elements of this rescripting would be Technology.  

Honorable PM in recent Bengaluru Tech Summit 2020 summit underlined the importance of technology. He remarked that, **“We are in the middle of information era. Future is coming sooner than anticipated. In the information era, the first mover did not matter; the best mover did, and anyone can make a product any time that disrupts all existing equations of the market”**.  *One such disruptive 21st century solution was Faceless assessment system launched by Department of Income Tax*.  The acceptance of this inovative solution in the field is encouraging and reassuring. Directorate of Systems is leaving no stone unturned in tapping the latest technologies in making our department more tech savvy, futuristic and world class.  

The fourth edition of our quarterly magazine **i-Tech** aims to provide a flash-view of the kind of technologies and problems which the directorate solves behind the curtains.  As with the previous versions, this edition also contains a mix of articles ranging from *Data sciences, Information Security, API based architecture, Network, Design, Data center and Quantum cryptography*. In addition to above, this edition of the magazine marks a significant milestone in our short journey. With this edition, we have decided to switch to **website-based model** for publishing articles. This makes our content easy to share, catalogue, reference and manage. The change from PDF based publishing model to Online model will also help us in shifting to anytime publishing mode and provide us a bigger private platform for participating in the technology and cadre related discussions.  

We hope the content of this magazine will help in bridging the gap between Systems and other limbs of the department and would provide more acceptance and space to systems in the creating a department of 21st century.
